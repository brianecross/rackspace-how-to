Let’s face it, it’s probably been a while since you’ve changed your email password. It’s a good idea to update it periodically and to use an original password that you don’t use anywhere else. After all, your email account is the key to your digital kingdom. If someone gets into your email, they can issue password resets for other sites and use your email to gain access. 

Over the last year or two, there have been many well publicized security breaches at many large web sites. These passwords are for sale in the dark corners of the internet and spammers are using them right now. Often users are unaware when a spammer is using their email account to send messages. They do it in a way that you may never know until we eventually shut down your account. If you’re lucky, there’s often no harm done, but once they’re into your account they could do a lot of damage using your personal information. 

So, let’s go ahead get your password changed. Use a fairly long password or better yet, a pass-phrase, and make it one that you’ve never used before for your email or any other account. Here’s how update your password in webmail:

1. Log in to your Webmail account by going to [apps.rackspace.com](https://apps.rackspace.com).
2. In the upper-right side next to your username, click the drop-down to access the **Settings** menu

3. In the left pane, click **Change Password**.
<!--insert image step 3-->
4. Enter your current password, then enter your new secure password and confirm it by entering it a second time.
<!--insert image step 4-->
5. Click **Save**.

After changing your password, **don’t forget to update your email password on your mobile device** and any other email clients you may be using.

Also, while you’re at it, go ahead and update your mobile phone number in webmail. That way, you’ll never have to worry about forgetting your password. We can reset your access upon your request at any time by sending a text message to your phone. 

Just click **Update Phone** from the drop-down next to your username, enter you mobile phone number, click **Save** and then you will receive a 6-digit verfication code on your phone to confirm your number. Your phone number will never be shared and will only be used for security related functions.
