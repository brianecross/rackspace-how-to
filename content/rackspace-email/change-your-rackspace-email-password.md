The password to your email address is the most essential tool you have in protecting your valuable information. If an intruder gets access to your email using your password, the intruder has access to your complete digital footprint, including resetting passwords for other sites associated with your email.

To protect your Rackspace Email mail account from intruders, you should regularly change your email password. Use the following instructions to change your password:

**Note**: Rackspace recommends that you make your email password different from the other passwords you use on the internet. The password should be one you have never used before and longer passwords are generally more secure. 

1. Log in to your Webmail account at [apps.rackspace.com](https://apps.rackspace.com).
2. In the top-right corner, click the account's username and then select **Settings**.

3. In the left pane, click **Change Password**.

4. Enter your current password and then enter the new password.

5. Click **Save**.

After changing your password, remember to update your email password on your mobile device and any email clients that use the Rackspace Email account.
